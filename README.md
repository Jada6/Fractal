# Fractals
Three fractals generated into SVG

## Spiral
Variation of binary tree fractal.
In each step the algorithm creates new edge of the spiral and new smaller spiral with opposite direction.

## Snowflakes
Randomly generated snowflakes.
Each wing of the snowflake is generated recursively: firstly, the longest subwing in the center is created and then the smaller subwings closer to the end of the wing with decreasing length.
Random factors: number of initial wings, number, angles, initial length and decreasing factor of subwings
